                <p> <b>Description:</b>
                    <br>
                    This project involved developing a stack data structure in Python, focusing on handling various data types efficiently. The stack was implemented using an object-oriented approach, allowing for operations such as push, pop, and peek. Additionally, I incorporated error handling to manage stack underflow and overflow conditions. This project helped me deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithm optimization in Python.
